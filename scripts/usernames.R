#!/usr/bin/env Rscript

# A script that takes in the usernames and related data from the survey
# and cleans it up for analysis. Does not work on the raw data file;
# works on an intermediate file that has been somewhat cleaned up.
# I am doing this so we can contact devs who were interested in being contacted
# about the ORB.

# Here are some notes on my manual curation process:
# For "bare" usernames with no forge mentioned, I added "unknown:" before the username.
# Where people clearly wrote in the name of their project or repository, I found it online and turned their comment into a URL.
# Made sure that input is of the format "GitHub: janedoe, GitLab: janedoe24", where the only commas are separating forge:username pairs, and the only other colons are in URLs.
# When parsing, I extracted the URLs first, so the only colons remaining are within forge:username pairs.
# I deleted one instance of "No longer available"--I guess this was someone who didn't finish the survey?
# I deleted one instance of "Firstname Lastname, GitHub"
# Removed the "@" if somebody put an "@" before their username
# Removed other miscellaneous little notes
# Some people put multiple usernames for the same forge. I'm guessing these are either: 1) a personal UN and a professional/organizational UN or 2) a personal UN and a repo name
# Some of the "usernames" look like repo names. I did not bother to investigate these. After we extract all the usernames we can find, we should try searching for repos with those names we couldn't find.
# At least one person entered "GitLSIT" as their forge. This is UCSB IT's version control system.
# One person put their email instead of their GitHub username. I left this as-is because I couldn't find them online.
